1. Bubble Sort: Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly compares and swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order until the entire array is sorted.

2. Selection Sort: Selection Sort works by dividing the array into two parts: the sorted part and the unsorted part. It repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted part and moves it to the end of the sorted part.

3. Insertion Sort: Insertion Sort is an algorithm that virtually divides the array into a sorted and an unsorted part. It iterates through the unsorted part and places each element in its correct position within the sorted part.

4. Quick Sort: Quick Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It selects a pivot element and partitions the array into two sub-arrays, where elements smaller than the pivot are on the left, and elements greater than the pivot are on the right. It then recursively applies the same process to the sub-arrays.

5. Merge Sort: Merge Sort is another Divide and Conquer algorithm. It divides the array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the two sorted halves to obtain the final sorted array.

The web app demonstrates the step-by-step process of each of these sorting algorithms, allowing users to visualize how they work and compare their performance.
